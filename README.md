# QA challenge

Hi there, thank you for trying this out. We'd like to mention a few things before you get started!

Feel free to adjust the project structure as you see fit. There are no specific requirements in this regard. We just want to see how you handle testing with Cypress and Jest. Currently, the project structure looks like this:

- src
  - components
  - graphql
  - hooks
  - icons
  - test
    - cypress

You can either create unit tests inside the components folder or create a separate folder; your call here. When it comes to cypress tests, this is the current structure of most of our projects, but you can also move this around as you wish.

What we would like to see is some unit tests, but of course we do not expect you to cover each and every component; do as much as you can or want. We'd also like to see some cypress tests. Inside the cypress folder you'll find the examples generated when you initiate cypress for the 1st time. They serve as a guide, so feel free to use them as examples or templates. For more in depth details, please have a look at the [cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test).

Most of the dependencies are already installed, but if you need any extra tools, go ahead and install them.

Hopefully you'll have some fun writing these tests and we look forward to discussing the results together.
